# Django-CRM

*(Customer Relationship Management app)*

The use of CRM by companies allows them to improve the sales performance of their products and services.  The more complex and time-consuming the sales process, the greater the improvement.  
This [CRM](https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm) is designed for individual use by any company - Enterprise CRM. Access to the company's business data remains solely under its control.

Django CRM is an open-source client relationship software. It is written in [Python](https://www.python.org) (python crm).  
Frontend and backend are almost entirely based on the Django [Admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/).
CRM app uses adaptive Admin HTML templates out-of-the-box.
Django is an excellently documented framework with lots of examples.
The documentation on the Admin site takes up only one web page.  
The **original idea** is that since Django Admin is already a professional object management interface with a flexible permissions system for users (view, change, add, and delete objects), all you need to do is create models for the objects (such as Leads, Requests, Deals, Companies, etc.) and add business logic.      

All this ensures:
- significantly easier project customization and development;
- simpler project deployment and production server support.

The software package provides two websites: a CRM site for all users and a site for administrators.  
The **project code is stable** (has been in practical use for many years).

## Elevate Your Team's Productivity with Collaborative CRM Solution
This CRM is designed to enhance collaboration within teams and streamline project management processes. As a collaborative CRM, it allows users to create and manage memos, tasks, and projects with ease. Office memos can be directed to department heads or company executives, who can then transform these memos into tasks or projects, assigning responsible persons or executors. Tasks can be individual or collective. Tasks provide features such as chat discussions, file sharing, creating subtasks, and sharing results. Users receive notifications directly in the CRM and via email, ensuring they stay informed. Each user has a clear view of their task stack, including priorities, statuses, and next steps, thereby enhancing productivity and accountability in collaborative customer relationship management.

## Main applications
The CRM software consists of the following **main applications** and their models:

- **TASKS app**:
  - Task (with related: files, chat, reminders, tags)
    - subtasks
  - Memo (office memo)
    - tasks / project
  - Project (*tasks collection*):
    - tasks
  - Tags
  - … (+ *3 more models*).

## Supporting applications
The crm package also contains **supporting applications** such as:

- Chat app (chat is available in every instance of a task, project, office memo and deal)
- VoIP app (contact clients from deals)
- Help app (dynamic help pages depending on user role)
- Common app:
  - User profiles
  - Reminders (for tasks, projects, office memos and deals)

In total, at the moment, there are 79 tables in the database.

## Additional functionality
- Web form integration.
  - CRM form has built-in reCAPTCHA v3 protection;
  - Automatic detection of the country and city of the user who filled out the form;
- User’s email account integration;
- VoIP callback to smartphone;
- Sending messages via messengers (like: Viber, WhatsApp, Skype).
- Work with Excel files to import / export company contact details.

## Email client
There is a built-in Email client using **SMTP** and **IMAP** protocols.
Among other things, this allows the Django CRM to automatically save a copy of all correspondence for each request and deal in its database. Even if the correspondence was carried out in the user’s mail account (out of the CRM). The ticket mechanism is used for this.

CRM is able to work with email accounts **protected by two-factor authentication,** like gmail.

## User Assistance
- On the CRM pages, there is a link to a help page.
  Help pages are dynamic. Their content depends on the user's role.
- Tooltips appear when you hover the mouse over many page elements, such as icons, buttons, links, table headings, etc.
- There is also a user guide file.
