# Reporting security issues

## Due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that they not be publicly reported.  

- For [CRM package](https://github.com/DjangoCRM/Django-CRM) security issues, please use the [“Confidentially Report a Security Vulnerability”](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature
or send a description of the issue via email to [django.crm@outlook.com](mailto:django.crm@outlook.com).

- For Django security issues, please see [Django Security Policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/).
