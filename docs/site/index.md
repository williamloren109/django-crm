Django CRM offers a comprehensive CRM solution and consists of the following core applications:

- TASKS
- CRM
- ANALYTICS
- MASS MAIL

The TASKS application does not require CRM configuration and allows individual users or teams to work with the following objects:

- Tasks -> Subtasks
- Projects -> Tasks -> Subtasks
- Memos (office memos) -> Projects or Tasks 

Each instance of these objects also has integration with:

- Chat
- Tags
- Remainders
- Files

Notifications within CRM and to Email are also available.  
All CRM users have access to this application by default.

Access to the rest of the Django CRM applications is only available to users with the appropriate roles, such as sales managers, company executives, etc.  
To use all the features of these applications, you need to set up CRM integration:

- with your company's websites;
- with your company's mailboxes and sales managers' mailboxes;
- with the service of receiving current exchange rates (if necessary);
- with VoIP telephony service (if necessary).
